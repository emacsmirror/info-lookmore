;;; Commentary:

;; This is some more stuff for `info-lookup-symbol' - a couple of specific
;; manuals to add and a couple of mode setups.
;;
;; Functions adding manuals are `interactive' you can use M-x whatever to
;; have it just for the current session.
;;
;; There's only a handful of manual-specific functions.  For anything else
;; see `info-lookmore-add-doc'.  Usually you have to find the node name for
;; the index, then check whether entries can be used directly or need a bit
;; of mangling.  The easiest is when there's a separate "Functions" or
;; "Functions and Variables" index.  See `info-lookup-alist' for the
;; details.

;;; Install:

;; Put info-lookmore.el in one of your `load-path' directories, and in your
;; .emacs add for example
;;
;;     (autoload 'info-lookmore-elisp-cl "info-lookmore" nil t)
;;     (eval-after-load "info-look" '(info-lookmore-elisp-cl))
;;
;; for each setup function you want.
;;
;; There's autoload cookies for the functions if you know how to use
;; `update-file-autoloads' and friends, after which just eval-after-load for
;; each you want permanently, or M-x for one session.

;;; History:

;; Version 1 - the first version
;; Version 2 - new info-lookmore-coreutils-index
;; Version 3 - info-lookmore-c++-use-c correction to file setup
;;           - info-lookmore-coreutils-index do nothing in emacs21
